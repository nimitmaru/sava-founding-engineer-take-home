# Sava Founding Engineer Take-Home

Build a **Trust Officer Dashboard** for managing trust distributions.

## Quick Start

1. Create a new Next.js project in your own repo (TypeScript + Tailwind recommended)
2. Copy the contents of `starter-files/` into your project
3. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`
4. Read `ASSIGNMENT.md` for full requirements
5. Build it, record a Loom walkthrough, and send us the links

**Time limit:** 72 hours

## What's in `starter-files/`

- `starter-files/data/ledger.json` — Transaction history (current balance: **~$1,471,300**)
- `starter-files/data/requests.json` — Pending beneficiary requests to process
- `starter-files/.env.example` — Required environment variables

## On AI Tools

Use whatever helps you move fast - Claude Code, Cursor etc. In your video, briefly share your process (especially any unique AI workflows you've discovered) and how you ensure quality when working with AI-generated code.

## Deliverables

1. **Your GitHub repo** with source code, `.env.example`, and a README explaining how to run it
2. **Loom video** (~5 min) demoing the app and walking through your approach
